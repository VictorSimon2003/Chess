# Chess
The project is a console-based chess game implemented in C. It allows you to play chess against another player or against the computer.

The main objectives of the project are:

-Implementing chess rules, including chess piece movements, capturing, and win scenarios (check and checkmate).

-Providing an interactive console interface for players to make moves.

-Incorporating computer AI to play against a human player, which involves evaluating moves and determining the best possible action based on a rating system.
